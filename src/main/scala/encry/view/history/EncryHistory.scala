/**
  * History implementation. It is processing persistent modifiers generated locally or coming from network.
  * Depending on chosen node settings, it will process modifiers in a different way, different processors define how to
  * process different type of modifiers.
  *
  * HeadersProcessor: processor of block headers. It's the same for all node settings
  * ADProofsProcessor: processor of ADProofs. ADProofs may
  *   1. Be downloaded from other nodes (ADState == true)
  *   2. Be calculated by using local state (ADState == false)
  *   3. Be ignored by history in light mode (verifyTransactions == false)
  * PoPoWProofsProcessor: processor of PoPoWProof. PoPoWProof may
  *   1. Be downloaded once during bootstrap from other peers (poPoWBootstrap == true)
  *   2. Be ignored by history (poPoWBootstrap == false)
  * BlockTransactionsProcessor: Processor of BlockTransactions. BlockTransactions may
  *   1. Be downloaded from other peers (verifyTransactions == true)
  *   2. Be ignored by history (verifyTransactions == false)
